        Avoid burnout.. Overworking yourself is a pretty common thing if you’re
        trying to study something in your nights after work and weekends. There
        was a point I hit where I would study and work a full day, then stay up
        until midnight or 1am working. I remember one weekend where I’d spent
        all day and night working on the tasks and also trying to work out, and
        by Monday evening, I felt simply exhausted. I realized then that I had
        probably burnt myself out. And I really needed to make time to rest...
